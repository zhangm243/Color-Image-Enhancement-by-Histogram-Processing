(a) Download the dark-stream color picture in Fig. 6.35 (this image is labeled Fig. 6.35(05) in the image gallery for Chapter 6). Convert the image to RGB (see comments at the beginning of Project 06-01). Histogram-equalize the R, G, and B images separately using the histogram-equalization program and convert the image back to jpg format. 
(b) Form an average histogram from the three histograms in (a) and use it as the basis to obtain a single histogram equalization intensity transformation function. Apply this function to the R, G, and B components individually, and convert the results to jpg. Compare and explain the differences in the jpg images in (a) and (b).
